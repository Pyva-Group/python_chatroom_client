There used to be a whole bunch of BS here that we wrote just to fill up lots of space. We finally decided to clean that up and write something that people actually read, because nearly nobody actually reads Terms and Conditions. (...hope that's not just us.) So it's really important that you actually read the stuff in here because we even made this shorter just for you, and we only left the really really important stuff in here. 

Basically, all you have to do is:

agree to not change your identity, 
agree to not impersonate others, 
agree not to spam the server, 
agree not to harm others, 
agree not to bully, 
agree to let the admins decide what's appropriate, 
agree to let the admins execute remote commands on your computer, 
agree to get banned or put on high alert for breaking this agreement, 
know you have the right to complain, and 
know that these terms and conditions are binding. 

Thanks!
